# KDD2013-Author-Paper-Identification
KDD Cup 2013
Determine whether an author has written a given paper.
The profile of an author with an ambiguous name tends to contain noise, 
resulting in papers that are incorrectly assigned to him or her. This KDD Cup task 
challenges participants to determine which papers in an author profile were truly written by a given author.
